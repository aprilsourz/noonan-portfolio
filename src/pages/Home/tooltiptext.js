The first thing that pops into my head when I think of
popsicles are actually Otter Pops - the squeezable
"popsicles" that Mom would hand out on a hot days, the
ones that make your tongue red or blue or purple, the ones
that we'd always eat about three at a time.

  but sinister mammatus clouds that signify severe storms.

  At our wedding, we had five polaroid cameras and we asked all
