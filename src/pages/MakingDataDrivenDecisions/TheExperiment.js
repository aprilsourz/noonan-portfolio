          For our first experiment, we wanted to leverage data that we already
          had access to. As we began recruiting for user research, we asked our
          tech lead to pull down real data for each user we would be talking to.
          Then, in the spirit of experimentation we simply put together several
          charts in Google Sheets to portray that data in a way that the user
          would easily be able to comprehend. We wanted to use real user data
          instead of showing designed mock-ups so that the reports would feel
          real to the users and they could get a true understanding of how this
          data may or may not provide value to them.
          <br />
          <br />
          We created three charts that surfaced, in a variety of ways, how users
          were spending their time. With these charts, we hoped to discover what
          information would most help users better prioritize their time.
